# Question 1

Download stock price data for Google (GOOG) from 2010-01-01 to 2019-12-31 and calculate simple return sequence using `dailyReturn` function and adjusted close price.

```{r}
# Do not forget loading quantmod library
library(quantmod)
getSymbols("GOOG", from = "2010-01-01", to = "2019-12-31")
ret <- dailyReturn(GOOG, type = 'arithmetic')


```

# Question 2
Apply the Ljung Box test using 10 lags on the return sequence in Question 1. What do you conclude?

```{r}
Box.test(ret, lag = 10, type = "Ljung-Box")
#we have a large p value and cannot reject the null, the data to lag 10 is independent

acf(ret, lag.max = 10)
```
