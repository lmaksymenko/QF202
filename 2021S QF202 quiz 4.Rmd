# Question 1

Generate 100 random variables that follow t distribution (df=5), and calculate the **excess** kurtosis.

```{r}
library(fBasics)
library(moments)
kurtosis(rt(10000, df = 5))-3
```

# Question 2
Generate 100 random numbers that follow normal distribution and plot Q-Q plot.

```{r}
#qqnorm
data = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
qqnorm(data)
```

# Question 3

Generate 100 random numbers that follow an exponential distribution with $\lambda=2$, then perform a Jarque-Bera test and state the conclusion of the normality test.

```{r}
normalTest(rexp(100, rate = 2), method = "jb")
#the p value is very small, we reject the null hyp. (that it is normally dist)
```
