# Question 1

1. Generate an autocorrelated sequence (length = 10000) that follows the following recurrsive equation
$$X_t = 0.5X_{t-1}+0.3X_{t-2}+\varepsilon_t$$
where $\varepsilon\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.5)$. (Hint: check recitation script and the help page for `arima.sim` function.)

```{r}
data_generate <- arima.sim(list(ar = c(0.5, 0.3)), n = 10000, sd = sqrt(0.5), mean = 0)
plot(data_generate, type = 'l')
```

2. State the order of the AR model.


3. Calculate ACF and PACF for the first 10 lags, state your conclusion.
```{r}
acf(data_generate, lag = 10)
pacf(data_generate, lag = 10)$acf
#the lag 1 is the best fit
```
